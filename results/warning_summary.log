----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port JB[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port JB[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
CRITICAL WARNING: [Timing 38-282] The design failed to meet the timing requirements. Please see the timing summary report for details on the timing violations.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_oscilloscope/u_adc_control/delay_nxt_reg[0]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_oscilloscope/u_adc_control/delay_nxt_reg[0]/L3_2/O, cell u_top_oscilloscope/u_adc_control/delay_nxt_reg[0]/L3_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_oscilloscope/u_adc_control/delay_nxt_reg[1]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_oscilloscope/u_adc_control/delay_nxt_reg[1]/L3_2/O, cell u_top_oscilloscope/u_adc_control/delay_nxt_reg[1]/L3_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_oscilloscope/u_adc_control/delay_nxt_reg[3]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_oscilloscope/u_adc_control/delay_nxt_reg[3]/L3_2/O, cell u_top_oscilloscope/u_adc_control/delay_nxt_reg[3]/L3_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_oscilloscope/u_adc_control/delay_nxt_reg[6]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_oscilloscope/u_adc_control/delay_nxt_reg[6]_i_2/O, cell u_top_oscilloscope/u_adc_control/delay_nxt_reg[6]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net u_top_oscilloscope/u_adc_control/mode_nxt_reg[0]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_top_oscilloscope/u_adc_control/mode_nxt_reg[0]/L3_2/O, cell u_top_oscilloscope/u_adc_control/mode_nxt_reg[0]/L3_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
