WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port x_mouse_pos[10] in module draw_display is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port x_mouse_pos[9] in module draw_display is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port x_mouse_pos[8] in module draw_display is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-7080] Parallel synthesis criteria is not met
WARNING: [Synth 8-3332] Sequential element (u_triggeri_3075) is unused and will be removed from module top_oscilloscope_basys3.

----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port JB[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port JB[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
CRITICAL WARNING: [Timing 38-282] The design failed to meet the timing requirements. Please see the timing summary report for details on the timing violations.
