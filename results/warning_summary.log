----SYNTHESIS----
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_x.inc_reg was removed.  [rtl/MouseCtl.vhd:450]
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_x.x_inter_reg was removed.  [rtl/MouseCtl.vhd:456]
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_y.inc_reg was removed.  [rtl/MouseCtl.vhd:514]
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_y.y_inter_reg was removed.  [rtl/MouseCtl.vhd:520]
WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port channel[1] in module adc_control is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port channel[0] in module adc_control is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port x_mouse_pos[10] in module draw_display is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port x_mouse_pos[9] in module draw_display is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-7129] Port x_mouse_pos[8] in module draw_display is either unconnected or has no load
WARNING: [Synth 8-7080] Parallel synthesis criteria is not met

----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port JB[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port JB[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
CRITICAL WARNING: [Timing 38-282] The design failed to meet the timing requirements. Please see the timing summary report for details on the timing violations.
WARNING: [DRC DPIP-1] Input pipelining: DSP u_top_oscilloscope/u_trigger/trigger_level_case2 input u_top_oscilloscope/u_trigger/trigger_level_case2/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
WARNING: [DRC DPIP-1] Input pipelining: DSP u_top_oscilloscope/u_trigger/trigger_level_case2 input u_top_oscilloscope/u_trigger/trigger_level_case2/C[47:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-1] PREG Output pipelining: DSP u_top_oscilloscope/u_trigger/trigger_level_case2 output u_top_oscilloscope/u_trigger/trigger_level_case2/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP u_top_oscilloscope/u_trigger/trigger_level_case2 multiplier stage u_top_oscilloscope/u_trigger/trigger_level_case2/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
