----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port JB[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [DRC RPBF-3] IO port buffering is incomplete: Device port JB[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
CRITICAL WARNING: [Timing 38-282] The design failed to meet the timing requirements. Please see the timing summary report for details on the timing violations.
